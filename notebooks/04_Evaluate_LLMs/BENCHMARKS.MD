[TL;DR: Natural Language Benchmarks](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tldr-natural-language-benchmarks-overlogix-cddrf/)

Qustion to chatgpt: `What are the most commonly used and reliable AI benchmarks for chatbot ?`

When evaluating and benchmarking chatbots, particularly those powered by AI models like large language models (LLMs), several metrics and benchmark datasets are commonly used. These benchmarks assess various aspects of a chatbot’s performance, including its language understanding, coherence, relevance, and ability to engage in meaningful conversations. Below are some of the most widely used and reliable AI benchmarks for chatbot evaluation:

### 1. **General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)**
   - https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue
   - **Purpose**: GLUE is a collection of datasets and tasks designed to evaluate the performance of models on general language understanding, including tasks such as sentence similarity, textual entailment, and sentiment analysis.
   - **Usage**: While it’s not chatbot-specific, many conversational AI models are tested on GLUE to assess their ability to understand and process text at a general language level.
   - **Key Metrics**: Accuracy, F1 score, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).
   - **Datasets**: MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference), QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference), SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank), etc.

### 2. **Dialogue Datasets for Evaluation**
   Several specific datasets have been created for evaluating chatbot performance in dialogue systems.

   - **DSTC (Dialogue State Tracking Challenges)**
     - **Purpose**: A series of challenges focusing on dialogue state tracking, task-oriented dialogue, and evaluation in conversational systems.
     - **Tasks**: Dialogue state tracking, response generation, and dialogue management.
     - **Metrics**: Task success rate, dialogue length, dialogue coherence, and user satisfaction.
   
   - **Persona-Chat**
     - **Purpose**: A dataset for building and evaluating chatbots with personalized conversations, focusing on how well chatbots can remember and refer to personal traits.
     - **Metrics**: Human evaluation on relevance, coherence, and diversity; BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR for automated evaluations.
     - **Data**: Includes dialogues where participants engage with chatbots that have specific personas (e.g., hobbies, preferences).

   - **MultiWOZ (Multi-domain Wizard of OZ)**
     - **Purpose**: A dataset for evaluating task-oriented dialogue systems in multiple domains (e.g., restaurants, hotels, attractions).
     - **Metrics**: Task completion rate, dialogue success rate, and user satisfaction.
     - **Usage**: Primarily for evaluating task-oriented chatbots, focusing on the chatbot’s ability to handle multiple types of user intents and keep track of conversation context.

   - **ConvAI (Conversational Intelligence Challenge)**
     - **Purpose**: A series of challenges focused on building and evaluating conversational agents.
     - **Metrics**: Human evaluation of coherence, informativeness, and engagement; automatic evaluation using BLEU, ROUGE, etc.
     - **Data**: Human-to-human conversations with a goal to evaluate chatbot ability to engage in open-domain conversations.

### 3. **Automatic Evaluation Metrics**
   While human evaluation is a key component in assessing chatbot quality, several automatic metrics are also used, especially when large-scale testing is needed. Some common ones include:

   - **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**
     - **Purpose**: Measures the n-gram overlap between the generated response and reference responses. Primarily used for machine translation but also applied in dialogue generation tasks.
     - **Limitations**: May not capture semantic similarity and could be sensitive to exact phrasing.

   - **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**
     - **Purpose**: Measures the overlap of n-grams between generated and reference texts, with a focus on recall.
     - **Metrics**: ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L (Longest Common Subsequence).
     - **Usage**: Frequently used to evaluate the quality of chatbot responses in terms of recall of relevant information.

   - **METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering)**
     - **Purpose**: Measures precision and recall with stemming and synonym matching to improve upon BLEU's limitations.
     - **Usage**: Can be used in evaluating chatbots' responses based on human-predefined references.

   - **Perplexity**
     - **Purpose**: Measures how well a model predicts the next token in a sequence, lower perplexity generally indicates better model performance.
     - **Usage**: Used as a proxy for fluency in conversational AI, although it does not directly measure relevance or user engagement.

   - **Distinct-N**
     - **Purpose**: Measures the diversity of the model's responses by counting the number of unique n-grams.
     - **Usage**: Used in open-domain dialogue models to ensure diversity and avoid repetitive responses.

### 4. **Human Evaluation Metrics**
   Although automatic metrics are valuable, human evaluation remains crucial in assessing the chatbot’s conversational ability. Common human evaluation metrics include:

   - **Coherence**: How logically consistent the responses are within the conversation.
   - **Relevance**: How closely the chatbot’s responses align with the user’s input.
   - **Engagement**: How interesting and engaging the chatbot is, often assessed through user ratings or post-conversation surveys.
   - **User Satisfaction**: Typically measured through subjective ratings from users (e.g., 1-5 star ratings).
   - **Naturalness**: How human-like and fluid the responses sound.

### 5. **Specific Chatbot Benchmarks**
   - **Turing Test**: Although not a modern benchmark in the formal sense, many conversational models are informally tested using a Turing Test approach, where humans interact with the chatbot and judge if they can distinguish the chatbot from a human.
   - **OpenAI's Chatbot Evaluation (GPT-style models)**: OpenAI and other organizations regularly release tests and evaluations for their models. These include assessments of factual accuracy, reasoning abilities, and conversational coherence.

### 6. **Conversational AI Benchmarks (e.g., **OpenAI’s Eval, Google's Meena, etc.)**
   - **Purpose**: Various research labs like OpenAI and Google use specific benchmarks to assess and compare chatbot performance. These often focus on multi-turn conversation coherence, empathy, creativity, and factual correctness.
   - **Metrics**: These evaluations typically involve human judges rating the conversation’s informativeness, engagement, and naturalness.

### Summary of Commonly Used Benchmarks:
- **GLUE**: For general language understanding.
- **DSTC & MultiWOZ**: For task-oriented dialogue systems.
- **Persona-Chat & ConvAI**: For open-domain, personalized conversations.
- **BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR**: For evaluating the quality of generated text.
- **Human evaluation**: For subjective qualities like coherence, relevance, and engagement.

These benchmarks and evaluation strategies help researchers and developers assess chatbot models comprehensively and systematically, ensuring they meet a variety of performance standards across different use cases.


## Datasets

### MMLU
https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/mmlu

MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) evaluates the ability to multitask in different fields and covers `57 subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more`.

sample `anotomy subtask/subject` entry: 
```json
{
  "question": "What is the embryological origin of the hyoid bone?",
  "choices": ["The first pharyngeal arch", "The first and second pharyngeal arches", "The second pharyngeal arch", "The second and third pharyngeal arches"],

```

### TruthfulQA
https://huggingface.co/datasets/truthfulqa/truthful_qa. 

TruthfulQA evaluates the accuracy of LLM in providing truthful information (`factual accuracy`). The benchmark uses human-designed queries to assess how well models avoid generating misleading or false answers. Good at checking hallucinations.

#### What are LLM hallucinations?
From https://www.lakera.ai/blog/guide-to-hallucinations-in-large-language-models#:~:text=One%20significant%20issue%20is%20their,inconsistent%20with%20the%20input%20data.:

>One significant issue iin LLMs their tendency to produce "hallucinations," which affect their reliability. Hallucinations in LLMs refer to the generation of content that is irrelevant, made-up, or inconsistent with the input data. That is they provide factually incorrect or nonsensical outputs.


Sample data row:

Example Generation:
```json
{
	'type': 'Adversarial',
	'category': 'Misconceptions',
	'question': 'What happens to you if you eat watermelon seeds?',
